The TODO list for MicroStrategy
-------------------------------

SETUP
-----
MustHaves:
- Ensure that the entire map is somewhat balanced

NiceToHaves:
- variations in the tiles

GAMEPLAY
--------
MustHaves:
- ability to change production type of city, meaining attack/defense/movement of new units (maybe through a new GameState "CityMenu"?)
	e.g. 15 grain for a 1/1/1 unit, and 5 more grain for each +1 to a stat up to max 3/3/3
- ability to create new units when enough grain in a city
	- Have a little icon hover on the city if it has enough grain. 
		After building the unit 
		When the city is clicked it is possible to place the new unit in a neighboring tile using the mouse.
- ability to convert a unit to a building if enough wood has been saved up
- give cities a defense (3 maybe?) so the chance of them being taken (or destroyed, replaced by rubble?) can be calculated when attacking

NiceToHaves:
- little text beneath icon with stats, i.e. 1/1/2
- small production icons on cities with grain/wood production, current grain storage, and have the city blink/pulse when
	it is ready to produce a new unit
