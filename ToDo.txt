GAMEPLAY
--------
MustHaves:
- ability to change production type of city: attack/defense/movement of new units (maybe through a new GameState "CityMenu"?)
- ability to create new units when enough grain in a city
	- Have a little icon hover on the city if it has enough grain. 
		When the city is clicked it is possible to place the new unit in a neighboring tile using the mouse.
